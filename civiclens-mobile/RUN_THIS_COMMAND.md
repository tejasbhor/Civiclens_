# Install Required Package

Run this command to install react-native-svg:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install react-native-svg@^15.8.0 which I've added to package.json.

After installation, restart the Metro bundler:

```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart
npm start
```

The implementation guide is in `BOTTOM_SHEET_IMPLEMENTATION.md` with all the code you need.

Due to the complexity of the current file structure, I recommend:

1. Install the package first (npm install)
2. Review the implementation guide
3. Let me know if you want me to create a clean version of the entire CitizenHomeScreen.tsx file

The current file has some nested/duplicate code that needs careful refactoring.
