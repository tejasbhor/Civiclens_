## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **State Management:**
```typescript
const [reports, setReports] = useState<Report[]>([]);
const [filteredReports, setFilteredReports] = useState<Report[]>([]);
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState("");
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState("all");
```

### **Load Reports:**
```typescript
const loadReports = async () => {
  const data = await reportsService.getMyReports({ limit: 100 });
  setReports(data.reports);
};
```

### **Filter Logic:**
```typescript
const filterReports = () => {
  let filtered = [...reports];

  // Filter by tab
  if (activeTab === "active") {
    filtered = filtered.filter(r => 
      ['received', 'pending_classification', 'classified', 
       'assigned_to_department', 'assigned_to_officer', 
       'acknowledged', 'in_progress'].includes(r.status.toLowerCase())
    );
  } else if (activeTab === "resolved") {
    filtered = filtered.filter(r => r.status.toLowerCase() === 'resolved');
  } else if (activeTab === "closed") {
    filtered = filtered.filter(r => r.status.toLowerCase() === 'closed');
  }

  // Filter by search
  if (searchQuery.trim()) {
    const query = searchQuery.toLowerCase();
    filtered = filtered.filter(r => 
      r.title.toLowerCase().includes(query) ||
      r.description.toLowerCase().includes(query) ||
      r.report_number.toLowerCase().includes(query) ||
      (r.category && r.category.toLowerCase().includes(query))
    );
  }

  setFilteredReports(filtered);
};
```

### **Tab Counts:**
```typescript
const getTabCounts = () => {
  const active = reports.filter(r => 
    ['received', 'pending_classification', 'classified', 
     'assigned_to_department', 'assigned_to_officer', 
     'acknowledged', 'in_progress'].includes(r.status.toLowerCase())
  ).length;
  const resolved = reports.filter(r => r.status.toLowerCase() === 'resolved').length;
  const closed = reports.filter(r => r.status.toLowerCase() === 'closed').length;
  return { all: reports.length, active, resolved, closed };
};
```
