    <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
      <User className="w-4 h-4" />
      <span>{report.task.officer.full_name}</span>
    </div>
  ) : (
    <span className="text-gray-400">Unassigned</span>
  )}
</td>

// Add filter:
<select onChange={(e) => setOfficerId(e.target.value)}>
  <option value="">All Officers</option>
  {officers.map(o => (
    <option key={o.id} value={o.id}>{o.full_name}</option>
  ))}
</select>
```
