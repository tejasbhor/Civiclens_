const sortedData = useMemo(() => {
  const arr = [...data];
  arr.sort((a, b) => {
    const dir = sortDirection === 'asc' ? 1 : -1;
    let av, bv;
    
    if (sortKey === 'category') {
      av = a.category || '';
      bv = b.category || '';
    } else if (sortKey === 'status') {
      av = a.status || '';
      bv = b.status || '';
    } else if (sortKey === 'department') {
      av = a.department?.name || '';
      bv = b.department?.name || '';
    }
    // ... other fields
    
    if (av < bv) return -1 * dir;
    if (av > bv) return 1 * dir;
    return 0;
