1. `civiclens-admin/src/components/reports/CreateReportModal.tsx` - Original create report modal
2. `civiclens-admin/src/components/reports/CreateReportModalV2.tsx` - Second version of create report modal
3. `civiclens-admin/src/components/reports/ProductionReportModal.tsx` - Production-ready create report modal
4. `civiclens-admin/src/components/reports/ReportModal.tsx` - Generic report modal (likely for creation)

### Documentation
5. `REPORT_SUBMISSION_SOLUTION.md` - Solution documentation for create report functionality

## Code Changes

### Frontend API (`civiclens-admin/src/lib/api/reports.ts`)
- **Removed Interface**: `CreateReportRequest` - Type definition for creating reports
- **Removed Function**: `createReport()` - API function for creating new reports

### Reports Page (`civiclens-admin/src/app/dashboard/reports/page.tsx`)
- **Removed Import**: `import { CreateReportModal } from '@/components/reports/CreateReportModal'`
- **Removed State**: `const [showCreateModal, setShowCreateModal] = useState(false)`
- **Removed Button**: "Create Report" button from the page header
- **Removed Modal**: `<CreateReportModal>` component usage and props

## Files Preserved

### Media Upload Components (kept for other features)
- `civiclens-admin/src/components/reports/MediaUploader.tsx` - General media upload component
- `civiclens-admin/src/components/reports/MediaUploadProgress.tsx` - Upload progress component
- `civiclens-admin/src/hooks/useMediaUpload.ts` - Media upload hook

### Other Report Components (for existing report management)
- `civiclens-admin/src/components/reports/AddUpdateForm.tsx` - For adding updates to existing reports
- `civiclens-admin/src/components/reports/modals/EditReportModal.tsx` - For editing existing reports
- All other report management, assignment, and workflow components

## Backend Status

The backend create report functionality remains intact:
- `POST /api/v1/reports/` endpoint still exists
- All database models and services are preserved
- This allows for future re-implementation or API-only usage

## Impact

### What Still Works
✅ View existing reports  
✅ Filter and search reports  
✅ Edit existing reports  
✅ Assign reports to departments/officers  
✅ Update report status  
✅ Bulk operations on reports  
✅ Report management workflows  
✅ Media upload for existing reports  

### What Was Removed
❌ Create new reports from frontend  
❌ Report creation modal/form  
❌ "Create Report" button  
❌ Frontend report submission workflow  

## Future Implementation

To re-add create report functionality in the future:
1. Restore the deleted modal components
2. Add back the API interface and function
3. Re-add the create button and modal usage in the reports page
4. The backend infrastructure is already in place and ready

## Verification

- ✅ No compilation errors in reports page
- ✅ No compilation errors in reports API
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ Clean removal with no broken references
