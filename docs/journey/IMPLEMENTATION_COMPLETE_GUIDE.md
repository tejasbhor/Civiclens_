├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  [All: 16] [Review: 0] [Critical: 7] [High: 1]    │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**7 Cards:**
1. **All Reports (16)** - Total overview
2. **Needs Review (0)** - Manual attention required
3. **Critical (7)** - Immediate action (hours)
4. **High Priority (1)** - Urgent action (days)
5. **In Progress (0)** - Active work
6. **Pending Verification (0)** - Awaiting approval
7. **On Hold (5)** - Paused/waiting

### **Officer Dashboard (Officer)**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  My Tasks                                           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  [New: 3] [Acknowledged: 2] [Working: 5] [Done: 8] │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**4 Cards:**
1. **New Assignments** - Need to acknowledge
2. **Acknowledged** - Ready to start work
3. **In Progress** - Currently working
4. **Completed** - Awaiting verification

## 🚀 **How to Use**

### **For Admins:**

1. **Assign Officer:**
   ```
   Management Hub → Select Report → Assign Officer
   ```

2. **Monitor Progress:**
   ```
   - Check "In Progress" card for active work
   - Check "Pending Verification" for completed work
   - View status history for audit trail
   ```

3. **Verify Completion:**
   ```
   Report Detail → Review work → Mark as Resolved
   ```

### **For Officers:**

1. **View Assignments:**
   ```
   Officer Dashboard → See "New Assignments" card
   ```

2. **Open Report:**
   ```
   Click on report → Auto-acknowledges ✅
   Status changes to "Acknowledged"
   ```

3. **Start Work:**
   ```
   Add comment/update → Auto-starts work ✅
   Status changes to "In Progress"
   ```

4. **Complete:**
   ```
   Mark as complete → Status: Pending Verification
   ```

## 📈 **Metrics & Analytics**

### **Timestamps Captured:**
```typescript
interface Task {
  assigned_at: DateTime;      // When officer assigned
  acknowledged_at: DateTime;  // When officer viewed
  started_at: DateTime;       // When officer started work
  resolved_at: DateTime;      // When officer completed
}
```

### **Metrics You Can Calculate:**

1. **Response Time:**
   ```
   acknowledged_at - assigned_at
   ```
   *How quickly officer responds to assignment*

2. **Time to Start:**
   ```
   started_at - acknowledged_at
   ```
   *How quickly officer begins work after viewing*

3. **Work Duration:**
   ```
   resolved_at - started_at
   ```
   *How long officer actively worked*

4. **Total Time:**
   ```
   resolved_at - assigned_at
   ```
   *Complete lifecycle from assignment to completion*

### **Example Metrics:**
```
Report #CL-123: Pothole on Main St
├─ Assigned: 2025-10-25 08:00
├─ Acknowledged: 2025-10-25 09:15 (Response: 1h 15m) ✅
├─ Started: 2025-10-25 10:30 (Delay: 1h 15m)
├─ Completed: 2025-10-25 14:45 (Work: 4h 15m)
└─ Total Time: 6h 45m
```

## 🔐 **Security & Validation**

### **Endpoint Security:**

```python
# Only assigned officer can acknowledge
if task and task.assigned_to == current_user.id:
    # Proceed
else:
    # Return unchanged report
```

### **Status Validation:**

```python
# Can only acknowledge if status is ASSIGNED_TO_OFFICER
if report.status == ReportStatus.ASSIGNED_TO_OFFICER:
    # Transition to ACKNOWLEDGED
    
# Can only start work if status is ACKNOWLEDGED
if report.status == ReportStatus.ACKNOWLEDGED:
    # Transition to IN_PROGRESS
```

### **Idempotent Operations:**

```python
# Safe to call multiple times
# Returns current report if already transitioned
# No errors thrown
```
