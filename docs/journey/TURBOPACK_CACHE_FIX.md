# Turbopack Cache Issue - Quick Fix

## Problem
Next.js Turbopack is not detecting the newly created `AdditionalActionForms.tsx` file even though it exists.

## Solution

### Option 1: Stop and Restart Dev Server (Recommended)

1. **Stop the dev server**:
   - Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal running `npm run dev`

2. **Clear the Next.js cache**:
   ```bash
   # In PowerShell
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next
   
   # Or in CMD
   rmdir /s /q .next
   ```

3. **Restart the dev server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Option 2: Quick Restart (Faster)

Just stop and restart without clearing cache:
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C to stop
npm run dev
```

### Option 3: Touch the File (Force Reload)

If the server is running, modify the file to trigger a reload:

1. Open `d:/Civiclens/civiclens-admin/src/components/reports/manage/AdditionalActionForms.tsx`
2. Add a space or newline at the end
3. Save the file
4. Turbopack should detect the change

### Option 4: Restart TypeScript Server

In VS Code:
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
2. Type "TypeScript: Restart TS Server"
3. Press Enter
4. Then restart dev server

## Why This Happens

Turbopack (Next.js 15's new bundler) sometimes doesn't detect newly created files during hot reload. This is a known issue with file watchers.

## Verification

After restarting, you should see:
- âœ… No build errors
- âœ… Page loads at `/dashboard/reports/manage/[id]`
- âœ… All components render correctly

## If Still Not Working

1. **Check file encoding**: Make sure the file is UTF-8
2. **Check file permissions**: Make sure the file is readable
3. **Check for hidden characters**: Open the file and verify it's valid TypeScript
4. **Restart VS Code**: Sometimes VS Code's file watcher gets stuck

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C), then:
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next
npm run dev
```

That's it! The build should work after restarting. ðŸš€
