```typescript
const [report, setReport] = useState<ReportDetails | null>(null);
const [statusHistory, setStatusHistory] = useState<StatusHistoryItem[]>([]);
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);
```

### **Load Report Data:**
```typescript
const loadReportData = async () => {
  // Fetch report details
  const reportData = await reportsService.getReportById(parseInt(reportId!));
  setReport(reportData);

  // Fetch status history
  const historyData = await reportsService.getReportStatusHistory(parseInt(reportId!));
  setStatusHistory(historyData.history || []);
