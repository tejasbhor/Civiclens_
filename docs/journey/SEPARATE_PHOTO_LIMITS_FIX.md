# ✅ Separate Photo Limits - FIXED!

## 🎯 **YOU WERE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT!**

Citizen photos and officer photos should be counted **separately**!

---

## 🐛 **THE PROBLEM:**

**Before:**
```python
# Backend counted ALL images together
existing_count = count(Media) where file_type = IMAGE
# This included:
# - Citizen submission photos
# - Officer before photos  
# - Officer after photos
# All counted as one pool (max 5 total) ❌
```

**Result:**
- Citizen uploads 5 photos → Officer can't add any photos ❌
- Officer uploads 3 before photos → Can only add 2 after photos ❌
- Wrong! They should be separate!

---

## ✅ **THE FIX:**

### **Backend Changes:**

**File:** `civiclens-backend/app/services/file_upload_service.py`

```python
# Now counts separately based on upload_source

# For OFFICER photos (before + after combined):
if upload_source in [OFFICER_BEFORE_PHOTO, OFFICER_AFTER_PHOTO]:
    existing_count = count(Media) 
        where upload_source in [OFFICER_BEFORE_PHOTO, OFFICER_AFTER_PHOTO]
    # Max 5 officer photos (before + after combined)

# For CITIZEN photos:
else:
    existing_count = count(Media)
        where upload_source = CITIZEN_SUBMISSION or None
    # Max 5 citizen photos (separate pool)
```

**What this means:**
- ✅ Citizen can upload 5 photos
- ✅ Officer can upload 5 photos (before + after combined)
- ✅ Total: Up to 10 photos per report (5 citizen + 5 officer)

---

### **Frontend Changes:**

**File:** `civiclens-client/src/pages/officer/CompleteWork.tsx`

```typescript
// Updated validation
const totalOfficerPhotos = beforePhotos.length + afterPhotos.length + files.length;

if (totalOfficerPhotos > 5) {
  toast({
    description: `Maximum 5 officer photos allowed (before + after combined). 
                  You have ${beforePhotos.length} before photos. 
                  You can add ${remaining} more after photos.`
  });
}
```

**UI Updates:**
```
Before: "3/5 images"
After:  "3/5 officer photos" ← Clarifies it's officer photos only
```

---

## 📊 **HOW IT WORKS NOW:**

### **Example Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Citizen + Officer Photos**
```
Citizen uploads: 5 photos ✅
Officer before:  3 photos ✅
Officer after:   2 photos ✅
Total: 10 photos (5 + 5) ✅
```

**Scenario 2: Max Officer Photos**
```
Citizen uploads: 5 photos ✅
Officer before:  5 photos ✅
Officer after:   0 photos (limit reached) ⚠️
Total: 10 photos (5 + 5) ✅
```

**Scenario 3: Balanced**
```
Citizen uploads: 3 photos ✅
Officer before:  2 photos ✅
Officer after:   3 photos ✅
Total: 8 photos (3 + 5) ✅
```

---

## 🔧 **PHOTO LIMITS:**

### **Current Limits:**
```
Citizen Photos:  Max 5 per report
Officer Photos:  Max 5 per report (before + after combined)
Total:           Max 10 per report
```

### **Breakdown:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ CITIZEN PHOTOS (Separate Pool)  │
│ Max: 5 photos                   │
│ - Uploaded when creating report │
└─────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ OFFICER PHOTOS (Separate Pool)  │
│ Max: 5 photos (before + after)  │
│ - Before: 0-5 photos            │
│ - After:  0-5 photos            │
│ - Combined: Max 5 total         │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🧪 **TESTING:**

### **Test Scenario 1:**

4. Result: 10 photos total ✅
```

### **Test Scenario 2:**
```
1. Citizen creates report with 5 photos

```

## 🚀 **RESTART BACKEND:**

**Important:** You need to restart the backend for the changes to take effect!

```bash
# Stop backend (Ctrl+C)
# Start backend again
cd civiclens-backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
