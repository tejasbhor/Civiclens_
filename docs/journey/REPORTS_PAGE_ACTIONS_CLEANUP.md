# âœ… Reports Page Actions - Cleanup Complete

## ðŸŽ¯ Changes Made:

### 1. âœ… Simplified PDF Export
**Before:** 3 separate PDF export options
- Export PDF (Summary)
- Export PDF (Detailed) - Admin only
- Export PDF (Audit) - Admin only

**After:** 1 simple PDF export option
- Export PDF - Exports summary version for all users

**Reason:** Simplified user experience. Users can access detailed exports from the full report view if needed.

---

### 2. âœ… Removed "Copy Report Link"
**Before:** Had a "Copy Report Link" action in dropdown

**After:** Removed

**Reason:** Not essential for the reports list view. Users can access the report directly by clicking "Manage Report".

---

### 3. âœ… Removed "Export PDF (Audit)"
**Before:** Had comprehensive audit trail PDF export

**After:** Removed from dropdown menu

**Reason:** Audit exports are available in the full report management page where they're more contextually appropriate.

---

### 4. âœ… Removed "Export Data (JSON)"
**Before:** Had JSON data export option

**After:** Removed

**Reason:** JSON exports are technical and rarely needed. Can be added back as a bulk action if required.

---

### 5. âœ… Fixed Modal Z-Index Issue
**Before:** Modal could get hidden behind container when there aren't many reports

**After:** Modal uses very high z-index (9999/10000) with inline styles

**Fix:**
```typescript
// Before:
<div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black/50 flex items-center justify-center z-50 p-4">
  <div className="bg-white w-full max-w-4xl rounded-lg shadow-2xl max-h-[90vh] flex flex-col animate-scale-in">

// After:
<div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black/50 flex items-center justify-center p-4" style={{ zIndex: 9999 }}>
  <div className="bg-white w-full max-w-4xl rounded-lg shadow-2xl max-h-[90vh] flex flex-col animate-scale-in" style={{ zIndex: 10000 }}>
```

**Reason:** Ensures modal always appears on top, regardless of parent container styling.
