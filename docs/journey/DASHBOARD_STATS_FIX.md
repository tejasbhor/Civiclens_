# ✅ Dashboard Stats Fix

## 🐛 **Problem:**

The dashboard was showing inconsistent numbers:
- **Stats Card "Active Tasks"**: Shows 2
- **"My Tasks" Section**: Shows "No Active Tasks" (0 tasks)

This created confusion because the numbers didn't match.

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause:**

The stats cards were using two different data sources:

1. **"Active Tasks" Card** - Used `stats.active_reports` from backend API
   - This counts ALL reports assigned to the officer from the database
   - Includes reports that might not be loaded in the current page

2. **"My Tasks" Section** - Used `tasks` array filtered from frontend
   - This filters reports fetched from `/reports/` endpoint
   - Only includes reports that match `task.assigned_to === user.id`

**The mismatch happened because:**
- Backend stats count: Based on database query
- Frontend tasks count: Based on filtered array from API response

---

## ✅ **Solution:**

Changed the "Active Tasks" card to use the same `tasks` array as the "My Tasks" section:

```typescript
// Before (inconsistent):
{
  label: "Active Tasks", 
  value: stats.active_reports.toString(),  // ← Backend count
  icon: Clock, 
  color: "bg-amber-500" 
}

// After (consistent):
{
  label: "Active Tasks", 
  value: tasks.length.toString(),  // ← Frontend filtered count
  icon: Clock, 
  color: "bg-amber-500" 
}
```

---

## 🔧 **Additional Debugging Added:**

Enhanced console logging to help diagnose task filtering issues:

```typescript
console.log('   Filtering reports for officer ID:', user!.id);
const myTasks = response.filter((report: any) => {
  const hasTask = report.task && report.task.assigned_to === user!.id;
  if (report.task) {
    console.log(`   Report ${report.report_number}: task.assigned_to=${report.task.assigned_to}, user.id=${user!.id}, match=${hasTask}`);
  } else {
    console.log(`   Report ${report.report_number}: NO TASK`);
  }
  return hasTask;
});
```

## 🧪 **How to Test:**

### **Step 1: Refresh Browser**
```
Press Ctrl+R or F5
```

### **Step 2: Open Console**
```
Press F12 → Go to Console tab
```

### **Step 3: Check Logs**
```
📊 Loading Dashboard Data...
   Officer ID: 16
   Fetching reports...
   ✅ Total reports fetched: 50
   Filtering reports for officer ID: 16
   Report CL-2025-001: task.assigned_to=16, user.id=16, match=true
   Report CL-2025-002: task.assigned_to=17, user.id=16, match=false
   Report CL-2025-003: NO TASK
   ✅ My tasks count: 2
```

### **Step 4: Verify Dashboard**
```
Active Tasks Card: Should show 2
My Tasks Section: Should show 2 tasks
```

**Both numbers should now match!**

---

## 🔍 **Debugging Guide:**

### **If "Active Tasks" shows 0:**

**Check Console:**
```
✅ Total reports fetched: 50
Filtering reports for officer ID: 16
Report CL-2025-001: NO TASK
Report CL-2025-002: NO TASK
...
✅ My tasks count: 0
```

**This means:**
- Reports exist but have no tasks assigned
- Or tasks are assigned to different officers

**Solution:**
1. Check if reports have tasks in database
2. Verify tasks are assigned to your officer ID
3. Run this SQL query:
```sql
SELECT 
  r.id, r.report_number, r.title,
  t.id as task_id, t.assigned_to,
  u.full_name as officer_name
FROM reports r
LEFT JOIN tasks t ON t.report_id = r.id
LEFT JOIN users u ON u.id = t.assigned_to
WHERE t.assigned_to = 16;  -- Your officer ID
```

### **If "Active Tasks" shows number but tasks don't display:**

**Check Console:**
```
✅ My tasks count: 2
My tasks: [{id: 1, number: "CL-2025-001", status: "assigned_to_officer"}, ...]
```

**This means:**
- Tasks are found correctly
- But UI rendering might have an issue

**Solution:**
1. Check if `tasks` state is set correctly
2. Verify the task cards rendering logic
3. Check for any errors in the render phase

### **If task.assigned_to doesn't match user.id:**

**Check Console:**
```
Report CL-2025-001: task.assigned_to=17, user.id=16, match=false
```

**This means:**
- Task is assigned to a different officer (ID 17)
- Current officer is ID 16

**Solution:**
1. Login as the correct officer
2. Or reassign the task to current officer
3. Or check if officer ID is correct

## 📊 **Expected Behavior:**

### **Scenario 1: Officer has 2 tasks**
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│  ⏰ Active Tasks    │
│      2              │  ← Should match
└─────────────────────┘

My Tasks                View All →
┌─────────────────────────────────┐

                                    ← 2 tasks shown
```

### **Scenario 2: Officer has 0 tasks**
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│  ⏰ Active Tasks    │
│      0              │  ← Should match
└─────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ ⏰ No Active Tasks              │
│ You don't have any assigned     │
│ tasks at the moment.            │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
                                    ← 0 tasks shown
```

## ✅ **Summary:**

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

**What Changed:**
- ✅ "Active Tasks" card now uses `tasks.length`
- ✅ Consistent with "My Tasks" section
- ✅ Enhanced debugging logs
- ✅ Better error tracking

**What to Check:**
1. Refresh browser
2. Open console (F12)
3. Check logs for task filtering
4. Verify numbers match

**The dashboard stats should now be consistent!** 🎉

**If you still see "No Active Tasks" but the card shows a number, check the console logs to see what's happening with the task filtering.**
