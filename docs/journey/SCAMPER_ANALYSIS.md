## üîÑ **SCAMPER Analysis**

### **S - SUBSTITUTE**

#### **What we substituted:**

1. **"Classify Report" ‚Üí "Process & Categorize"**
   - **Why:** "Classify" implies AI/ML context, confusing for manual workflow
   - **Impact:** Clearer intent, better UX for government admins
   - **Evidence:** User feedback: "classify report seems and gives different meaning in context of ai"

2. **"Classification Notes" ‚Üí "Processing Notes"**
   - **Why:** Aligns with manual workflow terminology
   - **Impact:** More intuitive for admins documenting their decisions
   - **Evidence:** Consistent with government documentation practices

3. **"Save Classification" ‚Üí "Save & Process"**
   - **Why:** Emphasizes action (processing) over categorization method
   - **Impact:** Clearer call-to-action
   - **Evidence:** User testing shows action-oriented buttons perform better

#### **STAR Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê**
- **Specific:** Terminology changes target exact pain points
