# OFFICERS REAL STATISTICS INTEGRATION COMPLETE

## Overview
Successfully replaced mock data in the officers page with real backend statistics, creating a production-ready officer management system with accurate performance metrics.

## Problem Addressed
**Issue**: Officers page was displaying mock/random data for statistics:
- Total Reports: `Math.floor(Math.random() * 200) + 50`
- Resolved Reports: `Math.floor(Math.random() * 150) + 30`
- Average Resolution Time: `Math.floor(Math.random() * 5) + 2`
- Active Reports: `Math.floor(Math.random() * 20) + 5`

**Impact**: This made the system unsuitable for production use as it showed fake performance data.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend API Enhancement ✅

#### New Officer Statistics Endpoint
```python
@router.get("/stats/officers", response_model=List[OfficerStatsResponse])
async def get_all_officer_stats(
    db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db),
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)
):
    """Get statistics for all officers"""
```

#### Individual Officer Statistics
```python
@router.get("/{user_id}/stats", response_model=OfficerStatsResponse)
async def get_officer_stats(
    user_id: int,
    db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db),
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)
):
    """Get statistics for a specific officer"""
```

#### Statistics Data Model
```python
class OfficerStatsResponse(BaseModel):
    user_id: int
    total_reports: int
    resolved_reports: int
    in_progress_reports: int
    active_reports: int
    avg_resolution_time_days: float | None = None
```

### 2. Real Statistics Calculation ✅

#### Database Queries
The backend now calculates real statistics by:

**Report Counting**:
```python
# Count reports assigned to officer through tasks
reports_result = await db.execute(
    select(
        func.count(Report.id).label('total'),
        func.count(Report.id).filter(Report.status.in_([
            ReportStatus.RESOLVED,
            ReportStatus.CLOSED
        ])).label('resolved'),
        func.count(Report.id).filter(Report.status == ReportStatus.IN_PROGRESS).label('in_progress'),
        func.count(Report.id).filter(Report.status.in_([
            ReportStatus.ASSIGNED_TO_OFFICER,
            ReportStatus.ACKNOWLEDGED,
            ReportStatus.IN_PROGRESS,
            ReportStatus.PENDING_VERIFICATION
        ])).label('active')
    )
    .select_from(Report)
    .join(Task, Report.id == Task.report_id)
    .where(Task.assigned_to == user_id)
)
```

**Resolution Time Calculation**:
```python
# Calculate average resolution time using actual timestamps
resolution_time_result = await db.execute(
    select(func.avg(func.extract('epoch', Report.updated_at - Report.created_at) / 86400))
    .select_from(Report)
    .join(Task, Report.id == Task.report_id)
    .where(Task.assigned_to == user_id)
    .where(Report.status.in_([ReportStatus.RESOLVED, ReportStatus.CLOSED]))
    .where(Report.updated_at.isnot(None))
)
```

### 3. Frontend Integration ✅

#### API Integration
```typescript
export interface OfficerStats {
  user_id: number;
  total_reports: number;
  resolved_reports: number;
  in_progress_reports: number;
  active_reports: number;
  avg_resolution_time_days: number | null;
}

// New API methods
getOfficerStats: async (): Promise<OfficerStats[]> => {
  const res = await apiClient.get('/users/stats/officers');
  return res.data as OfficerStats[];
},

getUserStats: async (userId: number): Promise<OfficerStats | null> => {
  const res = await apiClient.get(`/users/${userId}/stats`);
  return res.data as OfficerStats;
}
```

#### Real Data Usage
```typescript
const getOfficerStats = (officer: User) => {
  const stats = officerStats.find(s => s.user_id === officer.id);
  if (stats) {
    return {
      totalReports: stats.total_reports,
      resolvedReports: stats.resolved_reports,
      avgResolutionTime: Math.round(stats.avg_resolution_time_days || 0),
      activeReports: stats.active_reports
    };
  }
  
  // Fallback to zero stats if no data available
  return {
    totalReports: 0,
    resolvedReports: 0,
    avgResolutionTime: 0,
    activeReports: 0
  };
};
```

### 4. Data Loading Enhancement ✅

#### Parallel Data Loading
```typescript
const [officersResponse, departmentsResponse, statsResponse] = await Promise.all([
  usersApi.listUsers({ per_page: 100 }),
  departmentsApi.list(),
  usersApi.getOfficerStats()  // New statistics loading
]);
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Backend Architecture
