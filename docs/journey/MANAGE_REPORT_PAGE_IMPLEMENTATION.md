# Manage Report Page - Complete Lifecycle Implementation

## Overview
The Manage Report page (`/dashboard/reports/manage/[id]`) has been completely redesigned to handle the **entire report lifecycle** from submission to closure, following the production-ready workflow you specified.

## 🎯 Purpose
This page serves as the **central hub** for managing all aspects of a civic report:
- **Visualize** the complete report lifecycle with workflow stages
- **Take actions** based on current report status
- **Track progress** through tasks, assignments, and timeline
- **Handle** appeals and escalations
- **Manage** all report metadata and relationships

## 🔄 Complete Report Lifecycle Flow

### Phase 1: Submission & Classification
**Status: RECEIVED → PENDING_CLASSIFICATION → CLASSIFIED**

**Available Actions:**
- ✅ Classify Report (Set category & severity)
- ✅ Assign Department (Route to appropriate department)

**Backend Endpoints:**
- `PUT /api/v1/reports/{id}/classify`
- `POST /api/v1/reports/{id}/assign-department`

### Phase 2: Department & Officer Assignment
**Status: ASSIGNED_TO_DEPARTMENT → ASSIGNED_TO_OFFICER**

**Available Actions:**
- ✅ Assign Officer (Create task for field officer)
- ✅ Auto-assign Officer (Intelligent workload balancing)

**Backend Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/v1/reports/{id}/assign-officer`

### Phase 3: Officer Workflow
**Status: ACKNOWLEDGED → IN_PROGRESS → PENDING_VERIFICATION**

**Available Actions:**
- ✅ Acknowledge (Officer accepts task)
- ✅ Start Work (Begin resolution)
- ✅ Submit for Verification (Mark work complete)
- ✅ Put on Hold (Pause work)

**Backend Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/v1/reports/{id}/acknowledge`
- `POST /api/v1/reports/{id}/start-work`
- `POST /api/v1/reports/{id}/status`

### Phase 4: Verification & Resolution
**Status: PENDING_VERIFICATION → RESOLVED → CLOSED**

**Available Actions:**
- ✅ Approve Resolution (Mark as resolved)
