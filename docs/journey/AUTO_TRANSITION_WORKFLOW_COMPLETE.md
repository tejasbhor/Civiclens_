# ✅ Auto-Transition Workflow - COMPLETE

**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Feature:** Automatic status transitions based on officer actions

---

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**

### **Before:**
- Officers had to manually update status at each step
- Confusing workflow with multiple manual transitions
- Status often outdated or forgotten
- No clear accountability

### **After:**
- ✅ **Automatic transitions** based on actual actions
- ✅ **Seamless workflow** for officers
- ✅ **Accurate tracking** of engagement and work
- ✅ **Clear accountability** with timestamps

---

## 🔄 **New Workflow**

### **Admin Side:**
```
1. Admin assigns officer
   ↓
   Status: ASSIGNED_TO_OFFICER
   Task: Created with status ASSIGNED
```

### **Officer Side (Automatic):**
```
2. Officer opens/views report
   ↓
   POST /reports/{id}/acknowledge
   ↓
   Status: ACKNOWLEDGED
   Task: status = ACKNOWLEDGED, acknowledged_at = now()
   
3. Officer adds comment/update
   ↓
   POST /reports/{id}/start-work
   ↓
   Status: IN_PROGRESS
   Task: status = IN_PROGRESS, started_at = now()
   
4. Officer marks complete
   ↓
   Status: PENDING_VERIFICATION
   Task: status = RESOLVED, resolved_at = now()
```

## 📡 **New API Endpoints**

### **1. Auto-Acknowledge**
```http
POST /api/v1/reports/{report_id}/acknowledge
```

**Purpose:** Automatically acknowledge when officer views report

**Conditions:**
- Report status must be `ASSIGNED_TO_OFFICER`
- Current user must be the assigned officer
- Task must exist for this report

**Actions:**
- ✅ Update report status → `ACKNOWLEDGED`
- ✅ Update task status → `ACKNOWLEDGED`
- ✅ Set `task.acknowledged_at` timestamp
- ✅ Record status history

**Response:** Updated Report object

---

### **2. Auto-Start Work**
```http
POST /api/v1/reports/{report_id}/start-work
```

**Purpose:** Automatically start work when officer adds update

**Conditions:**
- Report status must be `ACKNOWLEDGED`
- Current user must be the assigned officer
- Task must exist for this report

**Actions:**
- ✅ Update report status → `IN_PROGRESS`
- ✅ Update task status → `IN_PROGRESS`
- ✅ Set `task.started_at` timestamp
- ✅ Record status history

**Response:** Updated Report object

---

## 💻 **Frontend Integration**

### **Added to `reportsApi`:**

```typescript
// src/lib/api/reports.ts

export const reportsApi = {
  // ... existing methods
  
  // Auto-transitions (Officer workflow)
  acknowledgeReport: async (id: number): Promise<Report> => {
    const response = await apiClient.post(`/reports/${id}/acknowledge`);
    return response.data;
  },

  startWork: async (id: number): Promise<Report> => {
    const response = await apiClient.post(`/reports/${id}/start-work`);
    return response.data;
  },
};
```

---

## 🎨 **Usage Examples**

### **Example 1: Officer Dashboard**

```typescript
// When officer clicks on a report
const handleReportClick = async (reportId: number) => {
  // Navigate to detail page
  router.push(`/officer/reports/${reportId}`);
  
  // Auto-acknowledge in background
  try {
    await reportsApi.acknowledgeReport(reportId);
    // Report is now ACKNOWLEDGED
  } catch (e) {
    // Already acknowledged or not assigned to this officer
  }
};
```

### **Example 2: Officer Adds Comment**

```typescript
// When officer adds first comment/update
const handleAddComment = async (reportId: number, comment: string) => {
  // Start work automatically
  try {
    await reportsApi.startWork(reportId);
    // Report is now IN_PROGRESS
  } catch (e) {
    // Already in progress or not acknowledged yet
  }
  
  // Add the comment
  await commentsApi.addComment(reportId, comment);
};
```

### **Example 3: Report Detail Page**

```typescript
// On report detail page load
useEffect(() => {
  const loadReport = async () => {
    const report = await reportsApi.getReportById(reportId);
    setReport(report);
    
    // If officer viewing their assigned report, auto-acknowledge
    if (
      report.status === 'assigned_to_officer' &&
      currentUser.role === 'officer'
    ) {
      await reportsApi.acknowledgeReport(reportId);
      // Reload to show updated status
      const updated = await reportsApi.getReportById(reportId);
      setReport(updated);
    }
  };
  
  loadReport();
}, [reportId]);
```

## 📊 **Status Tracking**

### **Timestamps Captured:**

| Action | Timestamp Field | Purpose |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| Officer assigned | `task.assigned_at` | When task created |
| Officer views | `task.acknowledged_at` | Response time tracking |
| Officer starts work | `task.started_at` | Work time tracking |
| Officer completes | `task.resolved_at` | Completion tracking |

### **Metrics You Can Now Track:**

1. **Response Time:** `acknowledged_at - assigned_at`
2. **Time to Start:** `started_at - acknowledged_at`
3. **Work Duration:** `resolved_at - started_at`
4. **Total Time:** `resolved_at - assigned_at`

---

## 🔐 **Security & Validation**

### **Built-in Checks:**

✅ **Officer Verification:**
- Only assigned officer can acknowledge/start work
- Checks `task.assigned_to == current_user.id`

✅ **Status Validation:**
- Can only acknowledge if status is `ASSIGNED_TO_OFFICER`
- Can only start work if status is `ACKNOWLEDGED`
- Uses existing transition validation rules

✅ **Idempotent:**
- Safe to call multiple times
- Returns current report if already transitioned
- No errors if status already changed

---

## 🎯 **Benefits**

### **For Officers:**
- ✅ No manual status updates needed
- ✅ Automatic tracking of their work
- ✅ Simpler workflow
- ✅ Focus on solving issues, not updating statuses

### **For Admins:**
- ✅ Accurate real-time status
- ✅ Know when officers engage with reports
- ✅ Track response times
- ✅ Better accountability

### **For System:**
- ✅ Accurate metrics
- ✅ Complete audit trail
- ✅ SLA compliance tracking
- ✅ Performance analytics

---

## 📈 **Dashboard Impact**

### **Management Hub Cards:**

```
In Progress: X
```

This now accurately shows:
- Reports where officers are **actively working**
- Not just "assigned" but actually **in progress**
- Real-time view of active work

### **Officer Dashboard (Future):**

```
My Assigned (5)        → Need to acknowledge
Acknowledged (3)       → Need to start work
In Progress (7)        → Currently working
Completed (12)         → Awaiting verification
```

## 🔄 **Complete Flow Example**

### **Scenario: Pothole Report**

```
1. Citizen reports pothole
   Status: RECEIVED
   
2. Admin classifies as "roads", severity "high"
   Status: CLASSIFIED
   
3. Admin assigns to Roads Department
   Status: ASSIGNED_TO_DEPARTMENT
   
4. Department head assigns to Officer John
   Status: ASSIGNED_TO_OFFICER
   Task: Created, assigned_to = John
   
5. John opens his dashboard, clicks report
   → Auto-calls: POST /reports/123/acknowledge
   Status: ACKNOWLEDGED
   Task: acknowledged_at = 2025-10-25 09:30:00
   
6. John adds comment: "Inspecting site today"
   → Auto-calls: POST /reports/123/start-work
   Status: IN_PROGRESS
   Task: started_at = 2025-10-25 10:15:00
   
7. John adds update: "Repair crew dispatched"
   Status: Still IN_PROGRESS (no change)
   
8. John marks complete: "Pothole filled"
   Status: PENDING_VERIFICATION
   Task: resolved_at = 2025-10-25 14:30:00
   
9. Admin verifies and approves
   Status: RESOLVED
   
Metrics:
- Response Time: 45 minutes (09:30 - 08:45)
- Time to Start: 45 minutes (10:15 - 09:30)
- Work Duration: 4 hours 15 minutes (14:30 - 10:15)
- Total Time: 5 hours 45 minutes (14:30 - 08:45)
```

## 🧪 **Testing**

### **Test Cases:**

1. ✅ **Officer acknowledges their assigned report**
   - Status changes to ACKNOWLEDGED
   - Timestamp recorded
   - History entry created

2. ✅ **Officer tries to acknowledge someone else's report**
   - Returns current report unchanged
   - No error thrown

3. ✅ **Officer acknowledges already acknowledged report**
   - Returns current report
   - Idempotent behavior

4. ✅ **Officer starts work on acknowledged report**
   - Status changes to IN_PROGRESS
   - Timestamp recorded

5. ✅ **Officer tries to start work before acknowledging**
   - Returns current report unchanged
   - Must acknowledge first

✅ Optional feature - doesn't break anything

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

### **Phase 1: Backend (COMPLETE)** ✅
- ✅ Add `/acknowledge` endpoint
- ✅ Add `/start-work` endpoint
- ✅ Validate officer assignment
- ✅ Update task timestamps

### **Phase 2: Frontend (COMPLETE)** ✅

- ✅ Ready for integration

### **Phase 3: Integration (TODO)**
- [ ] Add auto-acknowledge to report detail page
- [ ] Add auto-start to comment/update actions
- [ ] Create officer dashboard
- [ ] Add metrics/analytics

### **Phase 4: Enhancement (FUTURE)**
- [ ] Email notifications on status changes
- [ ] Mobile app integration
- [ ] SLA alerts
- [ ] Performance dashboards
