## 📊 **Component Architecture**

```
src/components/reports/manage/
├── StatusActions.tsx       (Context-aware action buttons)
├── LifecycleTracker.tsx    (Progress visualization)
├── SLATracker.tsx          (Time tracking & alerts)

## 🎨 **Design Patterns Used**

### **1. Context-Aware UI**
Actions change dynamically based on report status, showing only relevant options.

### **2. Progressive Disclosure**
- Primary actions highlighted
- Secondary actions available but less prominent
- Danger actions clearly marked in red

### **3. Visual Hierarchy**
- Icons for quick recognition
- Color coding for status (green/yellow/red)
- Clear typography hierarchy

### **4. Guided Workflow**
- Descriptions explain what each action does
- Primary action suggests next best step
- SLA alerts guide urgency

## 📋 **Integration Guide**

### **How to Use in Manage Page:**

```tsx
import { StatusActions, LifecycleTracker, SLATracker } from '@/components/reports/manage';

export default function ManageReportPage() {
  const handleAction = (action: string) => {
    switch (action) {
      case 'classify':
        setShowClassifyModal(true);
        break;
      case 'assign-department':
        setShowDepartmentModal(true);
        break;
      case 'assign-officer':
        setShowOfficerModal(true);
        break;
      // ... handle all actions
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-5 gap-6">
      {/* Left Column */}
      <div className="lg:col-span-2">
        {/* Existing sections */}
      </div>

      {/* Right Column */}
      <div className="lg:col-span-3 space-y-6">
        <LifecycleTracker report={report} history={history?.history} />
        <SLATracker report={report} />
        <StatusActions report={report} onAction={handleAction} />
        {/* Other sections */}
