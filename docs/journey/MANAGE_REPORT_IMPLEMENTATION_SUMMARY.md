# Manage Report Page - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 What Was Done

I've completely redesigned the **Manage Report page** (`/dashboard/reports/manage/[id]`) to handle the **entire report lifecycle** from citizen submission to final closure, exactly as you envisioned.

## ✨ Key Features Implemented

### 1. **LifecycleManager Component** (NEW)
**File:** `src/components/reports/manage/LifecycleManager.tsx`

A comprehensive workflow management component that:
- ✅ **Visualizes the 6-stage report lifecycle** with a progress bar
- ✅ **Shows context-aware actions** based on current report status
- ✅ **Provides inline forms** for quick actions (classify, assign, etc.)
- ✅ **Handles all status transitions** according to your workflow

**Workflow Stages:**
1. 📤 **Submission** (RECEIVED)
2. 🏷️ **Classification** (PENDING_CLASSIFICATION → CLASSIFIED)
3. 👥 **Assignment** (ASSIGNED_TO_DEPARTMENT → ASSIGNED_TO_OFFICER)
4. ▶️ **Work Progress** (ACKNOWLEDGED → IN_PROGRESS)
5. ✅ **Verification** (PENDING_VERIFICATION)
6. ✔️ **Resolution** (RESOLVED → CLOSED)

### 2. **Enhanced TabsSection** (UPDATED)
**File:** `src/components/reports/manage/TabsSection.tsx`

Added 3 new tabs:
- ✅ **Task Progress Tab** - Shows complete task lifecycle with timestamps
- ✅ **Appeals Tab** - Displays citizen appeals with admin responses
- ✅ **Escalations Tab** - Shows escalation history with SLA tracking

### 3. **Updated Manage Report Page** (UPDATED)
**File:** `src/app/dashboard/reports/manage/[id]/page.tsx`

- ✅ Replaced ActionCenter with LifecycleManager
- ✅ Integrated all new components
- ✅ Maintains existing layout and functionality

## 🔄 Complete Workflow Support

### Phase 1: Submission & Classification
```
RECEIVED → Classify Report → CLASSIFIED
         → Assign Department → ASSIGNED_TO_DEPARTMENT
```

### Phase 2: Assignment
```
ASSIGNED_TO_DEPARTMENT → Assign Officer → ASSIGNED_TO_OFFICER
```

### Phase 3: Officer Work
```
ASSIGNED_TO_OFFICER → Acknowledge → ACKNOWLEDGED
                    → Start Work → IN_PROGRESS
                    → Submit for Verification → PENDING_VERIFICATION
```

### Phase 4: Resolution
```
PENDING_VERIFICATION → Approve → RESOLVED
                     → Close → CLOSED
```

### Special States
```
Any Status → Reject → REJECTED
           → Hold → ON_HOLD
ON_HOLD → Resume → IN_PROGRESS
```
