const [stats, setStats] = useState({
  total: 0,
  active: 0,
  resolved: 0,
  closed: 0
});
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);
```

### **Data Fetching:**
```typescript
const loadDashboardData = async () => {
  const reportsData = await reportsService.getMyReports({ limit: 5 });
  setReports(reportsData.reports);
  // Calculate stats...
};
```
