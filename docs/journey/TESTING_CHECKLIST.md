## 🧪 What to Test:

### Test 1: Status Update After Officer Assignment ⚠️ **CRITICAL**

2. Find or create a report with status "classified"
3. Click "Manage" on the report
4. Assign to "Public Works Department"

**What to Check:**
- ✅ Report status updates to "assigned_to_officer"
- ✅ Task is created
- ✅ Officer can see the task
- ✅ Status history shows the change

**If it fails:**
- Check backend logs for errors

### Test 2: Date Formatting in Status History ⚠️ **CRITICAL**

**Steps:**
1. Open any report detail page
2. Scroll to "Timeline" or "Status History" section
3. Look at the dates displayed

**Expected Result:**

- ✅ No "Invalid Date" text anywhere
- ✅ Dates are properly formatted

**What to Check:**
- Timeline section dates

## 📝 What to Report Back:

For each test, tell me:
