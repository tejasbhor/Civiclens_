## How It Works

### Example Flow 1: Request Rework

**Scenario:** Admin reviews officer's work and finds issues

1. Report is in PENDING_VERIFICATION status
2. Admin clicks "Request Rework" button
3. Inline form expands with:
   - Feedback to officer (required)
   - Specific issues (required)
   - Priority level
4. Admin fills form and submits
5. System updates status to IN_PROGRESS with notes:
   ```
   REWORK REQUESTED: [feedback]
   Issues to address: [issues]
   ```
6. Officer sees report back in their queue
7. Officer addresses issues
8. Officer marks for verification again
9. Admin reviews and approves

### Example Flow 2: Flag Incorrect Assignment

**Scenario:** Officer receives report that should go to different department

1. Report is in ASSIGNED_TO_OFFICER status
2. Officer clicks "Flag Incorrect Assignment"
3. Inline form expands with:
   - Reason for flagging (required)
   - Suggested department (optional)
   - Suggested officer (optional)
   - Additional notes (optional)
4. Officer fills form and submits
5. System creates an appeal with type "incorrect_assignment"
6. Admin receives notification
7. Admin reviews appeal in Appeals section
8. Admin approves and reassigns to correct department/officer
9. New officer receives assignment

### Example Flow 3: Citizen Feedback (Future)

**Scenario:** Citizen wants to provide feedback after resolution

1. Report is in RESOLVED status
2. Citizen views resolution
3. Citizen clicks "Provide Feedback"
4. Inline form expands with:
   - Star rating (1-5)
   - Comments
   - Satisfaction checkbox
5. Citizen fills form and submits
6. System records feedback
7. If not satisfied, citizen can submit appeal
