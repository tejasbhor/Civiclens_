# Acknowledgement

We would like to express our sincere gratitude to all those who contributed to the successful completion of our capstone project, **CivicLens: An Intelligent Civic Grievance Triage and Management System**.

First and foremost, we extend our deepest appreciation to our project guide and mentor, **Prof. Aniruddha Chavan**, for his invaluable guidance, expert advice, and continuous support throughout this project. His encouragement and mentorship were instrumental in shaping our work and ensuring its successful completion.

We are profoundly grateful to **Prof. Rajendra Khade** and **Prof. Jyotsana Parmar** for their insightful feedback, constructive criticism, and technical guidance, which significantly enhanced the quality and rigor of this project.

We acknowledge the contributions of municipal governance research bodies and civic technology initiatives that informed our understanding of grievance management systems in Indian municipal corporations. Their work provided valuable insights into the challenges and requirements of civic administration.

We extend our appreciation to the open-source community and the developers behind the technologies that formed the technical foundation of our system:

- **React Native** and **Expo** framework for cross-platform mobile application development
- **FastAPI** for building high-performance asynchronous REST APIs
- **React.js** and **Next.js** for the administrative web interface
- **PostgreSQL** with **PostGIS** extension for spatial data management
- **Redis** for caching and background task queuing
- **Hugging Face Transformers** library, particularly the **BART** model (facebook/bart-large-mnli) for zero-shot classification
- **Sentence Transformers** (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for semantic similarity analysis
- **PyTorch** for machine learning model inference
- **scikit-learn** for supporting ML operations

These open-source tools and frameworks enabled us to build a scalable, secure, and production-ready intelligent grievance management system that demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence in civic governance.

Finally, we express our heartfelt appreciation to our families, friends, and teammates for their unwavering encouragement, patience, and support throughout this journey. Their understanding and motivation were vital in helping us overcome challenges and remain committed to our goals.

CivicLens is the result of collective effort, dedication, and a shared commitment to leveraging technology for social impact and improved civic governance.
